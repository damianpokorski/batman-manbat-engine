# Manbat engine

TLDR: Just offloading my old uni project here so I don't have to feel guilty about removing it from my hard drive.

# About
Manbat engine is an emalgamation of series of tutorials presented to me by my course leader, 
which of course I have decided to not follow. 

So I have wrote my code for most of the course, 
struggled a bit and learned a lot more about C++.

In the long run the quality of this game is pretty low, 
But it is a nice memory piece.

# Doubt anyone will find this useful. 
Would be a shame to delete it though.
